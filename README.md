# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster Project

This project leverages a machine learning model to process data from passengers aboard the Titanic during its voyage in 1912. We've developed a desktop application that utilizes this model to predict whether a user would have survived the Titanic shipwreck.

Through this application, users can input their details, and the machine learning model will assess their survival chances based on historical data. This project not only demonstrates the power of machine learning in analyzing historical events but also provides an interactive way for users to connect with history.
